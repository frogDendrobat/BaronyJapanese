
	Assessing the ZAP Brigade

	Guildmaster's Report

	Archmagistra,
	In regards to your inquiry:
	I'm writing to report on the strange band of individuals that have been sighted, who operate without guild sanction. They call themselves the "ZAP Brigade" and wield mighty staffs of lightning. Well equipped, they appear to patrol throughout all depths of the Hamlet mines. They appear in small squads ranging in size from just a few individuals all the way up to nine. You'll know they're near when you hear the loud fanfare they regale themselves with whenever they descend into dangerous territory. I have not seen them carrying any instruments with them; the music they create must be of magical origin.

	While they seek to slay any monsters they discover, of particular note about the ZAP Brigade is that they pride themselves in hunting down and destroying wild minotaurs; an impressive feat to speak of for sure, but one that our agents cannot confirm. It is frankly very unclear to whom they hold their allegiances, if they hold allegiance to anyone at all; but they seem peaceful and cooperative, so no one has ever complained of their presence. That said, they seem unorganized, and easily distracted. While they carry trinkets that guard them from accidentally destroying one another, the intervention of a true leader might transform them into a truly threatening force.

	It is my guess that they work with the wizard Merlin. Their reckless methods, penchant for drama, and fondness for lightning seem a clear connection to that oafish wizard. While it was wise to expel him from the guild many moons ago, following the disastrous experiment when he destroyed his own tower, this may indeed be concerning evidence of his continued meddling. However, Merlin and the ZAP Brigade are seen together so infrequently that this is little more than conjecture on my part.

	I hope this report is adequate for your strategic requirements.
	Bezel P.
	Guildmaster
