Controlling Goblins

Allan O'Gaffining to the Bullpen Party of Minetown

My camp was recently attacked by a band of Goblins. Everyone was killed but me and faithful Alex, who was able to snatch the last of the potatoes before we slinked away. These weren't just ordinary Goblins, they were led by a human. He danced like a fool, and was dressed like one too. The goblins who followed him seemed enamored with his whimsy, but there was a method to his madness. As he sang and danced, he would gesture toward priority targets. The goblins, normally separable with simple strategies, were unified, and they cut down our strongest men.

With no experience in organized tactics, we were helpless. But on reflection, I see we were just weak. As we fled the swamps, I spotted their leader again, sneaking upon another goblin and convincing him to join the warband with a whisper from behind.

After failing to mourn, my nightmares have produced a prouder path. Alex will return to lead the campaign through the mines. I'll make my way into the ranks of the Goblins. This could prove to be difficult. They have a foreign political and communal system that I'm going to have to weave my way into, and then take over as their king...It's going to be messy. But, as with every other political revolution, the mess is worth the outcome. We will grow our potatoes in the moist earth to feed our ever growing army.

Bullpen Party members of courage, prepare yourselves. Your time is now.
