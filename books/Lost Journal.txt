Dearest Journal,

It's been roughly a week since I last wrote.
I will now write as regularly as possible to record the history of the Goblin expedition of the mines. After becoming the most honored leader in Minetown, I have climbed my way up the political ladder of the Goblin system which is as easy as it sounds. They will listen to my every command.

Goblins are rather interesting. Their political system is run based on action and power. If a Goblin opposed me, I'd kill him and drink his blood. This got me to the top in a matter of hours. Some might say "Wow, you've really snapped from being isolated so long", to which I say, "Oh yeah. Big time".
I don't know where I got the idea to drink their blood. Something about my first night in the ruins. I dreamed of glowing eyes and pointy ears. Like a goblin. Better dressed. Some kind of goblin ghost maybe.

Anyway, I equipped my loyal Goblins with the bones of dead Goblins and steel swords as available and we've already wiped out two camps and taken their loot. We're a sort of underground pirates, I guess. I always thought being a pirate would be awesome. And if I need to assert my dominance by drinking more Goblin blood, well I suppose it's blood well-spent. Other food doesn't even taste good anymore.

I'll keep documenting for future generations to read from a first-hand source: their God-like leader's journey.
