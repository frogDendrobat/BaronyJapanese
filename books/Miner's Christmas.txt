'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the mine

Not a monster was stirring, not even a slime

The stockings were hung by the fountain with care

And everyone feared Baron Herx would be there

The miners were crammed not so snugly in beds

While visions of Baron Herx stabbed at their heads

The explorer with armour, and miners with caps

Were getting too unsettled for long winter naps

When down in the mines arose such a clatter

I sprang from the floor to see what's the matter

Away to the darkness I ran like a fool

And was suddenly torn open

God's sake, it's a ghoul!
