
	Mining My Soul
	Anonymous Miner


Mining, mining, mining my soul,
Working for Barons takes a mental toll

On top of the taxes, 
and the low wages,
He promised us work, 
but locked us in cages

I sought work for my life,
not to lose my wife,
and eat rats in my strife

Always be wary,
of silver-tongued leaders
Your reward may just be,
Bullies and beaters

Don't give them your life,
Stay in control,

or they'll end up mining, 

Mining... 

Mining your soul.
