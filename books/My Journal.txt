	After traveling for days, I've finally found it: the ruined town once known as Hamlet. What a ghastly place! Little grandeur remains in the architecture I read about from my travel guide. Most of the abandoned streets are littered with debris, but a clear path winds from the gates of Hamlet to the Abandoned Mine.

	As I approach the entrance to the mines, the ghoulish laughter and baleful glow emanating from within seem to diminish. The gateway is quite large, and the door only opens one way. Once I go in, it seems I shall not be coming out... but I am determined to dispel whatever evil has taken this place, and so I must proceed.
	
	My only hope is that my quest not be in vain. Gods above: protect me as I enter this forsaken place!
