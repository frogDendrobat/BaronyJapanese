Volume I
	
Giantism is a phenomenon that has only recently come under observation by the Magicians' Guild. Before Guildmaster Gregory initiated research on the subject 75 years ago, Giantism was little more than a legend passed among the residents of Hamlet. The most common stories were of rats or beetles ten times their natural size, but slightly less commonly, stories of lumbering hominids twice the size of a man were told as well. No one paid much mind to these stories until one of the aforementioned hominids was caught and killed by a local Hunter. News of the beast spread like wildfire, and the Magicians' Guild was finally forced to concede to the fact that these so-called giants did, in fact, exist.
	
While the exact cause of the creatures' gigantic scale is still very much unclear to the guild's researchers, one thing is for certain: It exclusively occurs in creatures with a certain habitat which, as far as the guild can tell, are localized to the mountains and caves surrounding Hamlet itself. Concerned about the possibility that Giantism is the result of a malicious hex cast over the region, the guild sent investigators. These became the earliest staff who eventually built up a guildhall in Hamlet. This was deemed necessary, as a security measure, to prevent any escalation of supernatural disturbances. 


So far, they've come up with nothing conclusive. With that said, the Hamlet Magicians' Guild tends to produce more adept magicians, and more powerful magic items, than other statistically similar guildhalls. Though Hamlet wizards claim to have disproven the theory, other Guildhalls have posited that there may be a link between the Hamlet magicians' aptitude, and Giantism itself.
