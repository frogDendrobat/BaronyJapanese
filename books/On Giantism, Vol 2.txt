Volume II
	
While the guild is not entirely certain of the history and causes behind Giantism, one thing that is abundantly clear is its effects. Giant creatures are, quite obviously enough, capable of much greater destruction than their more naturally scaled counterparts, and they also seem significantly more irritable as well.

The first giants ever studied at length were thought to be the only ones of their kind, and that is indeed the namesake of the condition of Giantism itself. These first giants were reported to be so irritable at times that they would not tolerate even the company of fellow giants. It was not uncommon, in fact, for one giant to attack another simply for violating its sense of personal space. Against advisement, if one were to find themselves facing off against such a giant, a sharpened blade would serve better than a spear or mace; their meaty flesh is accustomed to smaller pricks and shrugging off blunt force.
	
It is certain that Giantism can transform any simple and humble creature into a beast few would dare trifle with - and for now, this is all that the guild has to report on them as well. As we continue to conduct more field research and report our findings, expect to see further volumes.
