	Poem of the Mines
	
	by Anonymous



Looking for work,
We turned to the mines,
We spend all our earnings,
Back in the food lines,
We work three to three,
For a limp sack of gold,
Will Herx's paid guard,
E'er loosen their hold?


The vile Baron Herx,
That most wicked man,
Relentlessly works Hamlet,
Toward his wicked plan,
With swords at our backs,
By day and by night,
We toil for our keep,
In fear and with fright.


With imported food,
There is nowhere to turn,
Under this Baron's rule,
Hamlet will surely burn,
Give us courage, Lords above,
For freedom we yearn.

Back in the food lines,
Under the Baron's rule,

Give us courage, Lords above,
For freedom we yearn.
