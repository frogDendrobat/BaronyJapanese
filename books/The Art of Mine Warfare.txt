	To survive in these mines, you must be quick, nimble, and unseen, like an arrow in the night. Though the creatures may seem like predators in the darkness, the darkness hides you just as well. Hunt them and strike when they are unaware, and you will be on the way to victory.

	In mine warfare, the way is to avoid what is strong and attack what is weak. Do not first go after the strongest enemies, start at the least, and move your way up. From rats to spiders, not the other way around. You will be wiser every encounter, and get stronger. A fearsome foe can be avoided, and slain later. But if you hunt it at the wrong time and fail, you shall be slain.

	He who wishes to fight must first be able to pay the cost. Make sure you plan every attack, for it could be your last if not wise enough. Think, "Can I take this foe?" "Will I damage my armour?" "Where is the nearest merchant?" PLAN AHEAD. Force your enemy to reveal themselves, and you shall fight with ease. Outlast him. Outsmart him. Outwit him. When you have the first strike, you may land several blows before your target can retaliate even once.

	The supreme art of mine warfare is to subdue the enemy without fighting, after all. All warfare is based on deception. Carry around a dagger and nothing else, and keep your best weapon concealed. For when you are spotted, your enemy will think you weak, and you will have already won. Lay a trap, and leave them helpless against your blows when they seek you and instead stumble into it. They were dead the moment they decided to chase you.

	My last word of wisdom for you is even in the midst of chaos, there is opportunity. Do not forget what you came to the mines for, friend. You can take a break from warfare. Read a book. Exploring is a fine hobby, but you must try to live an excellent life again, as that is the greatest victory. 

	Good luck out there.
