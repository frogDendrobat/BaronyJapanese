The Lusty Goblin Maid 
Volume 1 Act 1 


*Scene opens with view of comfy goblin den, with a sexy goblin in a maid outfit sweeping the tables*

Goblin: Hey sweety, come over here for a second, would ya?

Maid: Yes mister! What can I do you for?

Goblin: *Lustful smirk* a few hours.

Maid: I'm sorry, sir?

Goblin: Oh, nothing. I need you to sharpen my spear. I'm going to fight some miners soon, and I need my spear well-polished.

Maid: How shall I ever sharpen this spear? It's so...long, and rough. Surely I'll have to lubricate it first?

Goblin: A little spit should moisten it just fine, that should do the job.

Maid: Oh my, this isn't a job I'm used to! It's just so long. I doubt I can get it shiny enough.

Goblin: *Content smile* Ooooh, it'll sparkle, my dear. More than you know.

The Lusty Goblin Maid 
Volume 1 Act 2


Goblin: Dearest maid, I request your...assistance.

Maid: Yessir! What do you need? 

Goblin: I need you to...clear out my chimney.

Maid: Oh, but it's so dark and cavernous, how shall I ever reach up there?

Goblin: Just work your sweet, succulent green hands up on in that dark hole of mine and work your way around with that broom.

Maid: Oh alright then sir, I'll work my way into your chamber.

Goblin: Oh wow, you really know your way around here.

Maid: Certainly sir, I've spent hours up in this hole of yours.

Goblin: How could I forget? Oh wow, the buildup is about to erupt over the crown! Work it harder!

Maid: I'm working it as hard as I can, Master!

*Eruption of smoke and ash emerges from the chimney, the maid returns with her face covered in white dust*

Maid: Satisfied, master? I tried my very best.

Goblin: For the time being, my dear. You are magic with your hands, I tell you what.
