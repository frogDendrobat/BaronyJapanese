My dearest Emily,


Conditions in the mine have gotten so, so bad. It has been 2 weeks since I have been able to see your beautiful face, and the kids. Tomorrow, we are locking Baron Herx up in the bottom of the dungeons. I may never see the surface again. I may never see you again, which is my biggest regret. If I donâ€™t, I have left 3,000 gold coins in the bedside drawer, and 10,000 goldsworth of stolen goods from the mine. 
I worry that with the Baron trapped, the citizens of Hamlet will become complacent. Do not be tempted to stay. Move, Emily. Move far away from this wretched land. Escape through the sewers to avoid the women in the plaza if you must. Buy a house in the Hangats, and never look back. There is nothing but death and destruction left in Hamlet. 

I love you, Emily, never forget that. 

Always yours,
~Reggie
