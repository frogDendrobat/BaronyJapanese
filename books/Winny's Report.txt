Winny the Gnome
Battle Report

Winny reporting in. Today we hauled in 5 picks, 6 pairs of leather boots, 10 doublets, 2 capes, 18 fish, a very fancy hat, and a tomalley. A very good day for this gnome colony. We tricked the tallsies out of their camp by having Zergo do one of his famous "Zergo rushes". He describes it like this: All run out and surround the tallsies while acting defenseless, only for a group to come in from behind, steal the loot, and then another comes in from the side and volley lightning upon the tallsies.

It's been working well! Most tallsie groups don't know what to do before we get them. Others don't go down easy and we've taken many casualties. Still, so far, we have not failed an ambush.

The goblin clans are making serious territorial advancements, and we fear they may target our group next. If they leave the bows and magicstaffs at home, we stand a better chance. They are led by some sort of hybrid of a tallsie and a Goblin, and they call him King. Quite the sight if I say so myself. Will report back later.
