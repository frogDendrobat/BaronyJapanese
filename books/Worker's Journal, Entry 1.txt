Day 1

Today is my first day down in the mines. I am very excited to get to work and be able to provide for the family. The job isn't ideal, the work is mundane, but the people are good and the wage is fair, and that's all that matters. I've had to give up my rations for 3 days just to pay the rising taxes, but with all the industry, those taxes'll shoot right down thanks to Baron Herx. Good man, he is. Things are finally shaping up here in Hamlet, just as we were all losing hope.
