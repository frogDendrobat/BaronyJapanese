Day 5

Things are getting a bit bleak. We can't leave the mines for some reason, and the Baron has soldiers watching us at all times. Work conditions are much worse than they once were, and I can't say I believe in Baron Herx anymore. I'm starting to think he's a tyrant. I came here to make more money and contribute to my city, but I am no longer able to see my family. They say my paychecks go directly to my family, but I don't even know if that's true anymore. I live in complete paranoia, darkness, and bitterness. I don't believe I will ever eat a proper meal with my family in a long while, if ever. If you've found this in the mines, please report Baron Herx's inhumane policies to the capital. Please.
