Day 11

The mines talk to me. I belong to the mines now. Others tried to escape, but we couldn't let them. They belonged underground, and now they shall stay underground. Most folks lost their family because of Baron Herx, and there are plots to keep him under here where he belongs. I support locking us in. We're too far removed. These mines stole my soul and gave me a purpose: To keep us safe under here. These walls...are...so beautiful. Anyone who tries to leave, I kill. When they bring Baron Herx down here for the trick, they've got me on the task of locking the door once they all leave. Fools. They shall never leave. No one will ever leave again.
